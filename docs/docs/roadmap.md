# Roadmap

The roadmap outlines topics that are currently worked on and gives an overview of the project's future direction.
We track and priorities planned features through the corresponding [milestones](https://github.com/bakdata/quick/milestones)
and [project boards](https://github.com/bakdata/quick/projects).

## Upcoming releases

### 0.9

Development: Q4 2022

* Providing DateTime support
* Addressing limitations and extending range queries, which means
giving users a possibility to:
    * make a range over the value field 
    * make a range exclusively on keys
    * make a range query with a composite key
    * make a range using DateTime

### Further ideas

* A possibility to deploy a mirror without creating a topic
* Extending `Mutation` possibilities, for example, to ingest an array of values
* Providing a `between` semantics for having a range open on two fields
* Simplifying the `@topic` directive
* Redefining topic semantics
* Improving Gateway Performance (using JSON instead of generic types)
* Supporting additional query arguments (for example, filters)
* Supporting custom authorization
* Supporting different ingress controllers like nginx
* Implementing a Kafka-Streams library for custom REST APIs in Quick
