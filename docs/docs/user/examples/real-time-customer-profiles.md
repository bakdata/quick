# Real-time customer profiles

This example demonstrates how you can use Quick to create real-time customer profiles for a music streaming service.
The profiles include user metrics,
charts of the most-streamed albums, artists and tracks,
and recommendations based on the user's playlist.

You can find the complete code in [Quick's example repository](https://github.com/bakdata/quick-examples).
The example uses the real world data set LFM-1b.
The Kafka Streams application is written with
our [streams-bootstrap library](https://github.com/bakdata/streams-bootstrap).

Every time a customer listens to a song, the system emits a listening event containing the ids of album,
artist and track to an Apache Kafka topic.
The system further attaches metadata like the timestamp to the event.
Then, a Kafka Streams application processes it for the customer profile creation.

```json title="Exemplary listening events"
{"userId": 402, "artistId": 7, "albumId": 17147, "trackId": 44975, "timestamp": 1568052379}
{"userId": 703, "artistId": 64, "albumId": 17148, "trackId": 44982, "timestamp": 1568052379}
{"userId": 4234, "artistId": 3744, "albumId": 34424, "trackId": 105501, "timestamp": 1568052382}
{"userId": 2843, "artistId": 71, "albumId": 315, "trackId": 2425, "timestamp": 1568052383}
{"userId": 1335, "artistId": 13866, "albumId": 29007, "trackId": 83201, "timestamp": 1568052385}
```

For modeling and querying data in this example, you first define a schema with GraphQL.
The query called `getUserProfile` combines six metrics of the customer profile:

- total listening events
- first and the last time a user listened to a song
- charts with userâ€™s most listened albums, artists and tracks.

Those charts, however, contain only ids and not the names of the corresponding music data.
You can let Quick resolve those ids with names.
For that, you use topics containing the mapping from id to names and then reference them in the GraphQL schema.

??? "The GraphQL schema (`schema-user-profile.gql`)" 
    ```graphql
    type Query {
        getUserProfile(userId: Long!): UserProfile
    }

    type UserProfile {
        totalListenCount: Long! @topic(name: "counts", keyArgument: "userId")
        firstListenEvent: Long! @topic(name: "firstlisten", keyArgument: "userId")
        lastListenEvent: Long! @topic(name: "lastlisten", keyArgument: "userId")
        artistCharts: NamedArtistCharts! @topic(name: "topartists", keyArgument: "userId")
        albumCharts: NamedAlbumCharts! @topic(name: "topalbums", keyArgument: "userId")
        trackCharts: NamedTrackCharts! @topic(name: "toptracks", keyArgument: "userId")
    }

    type NamedArtistCharts {
        topK: [NamedArtistCount!]!
    }

    type NamedAlbumCharts {
        topK: [NamedAlbumCount!]!
    }

    type NamedTrackCharts {
        topK: [NamedTrackCount!]!
    }

    type Item {
        id: Long!
        name: String!
    }

    type NamedArtistCount {
        id: Long!
        artist: Item! @topic(name: "artists", keyField: "id")
        countPlays: Long!
    }

    type NamedAlbumCount {
        id: Long!
        album: Item! @topic(name: "albums", keyField: "id")
        countPlays: Long!
    }

    type NamedTrackCount {
        id: Long!
        track: Item! @topic(name: "tracks", keyField: "id")
        countPlays: Long!
    }
    ...
    ```

You are now ready to process and query the data.
In case you don't have a running Quick instance,
you can refer to the [getting started guide](../getting-started/setup-quick).

First, initialize the Quick CLI.
Second, create a new gateway and apply the GraphQL schema.

```shell
quick context create --host "$QUICK_URL" --key "$QUICK_API_KEY" --context customer-profiles
quick gateway create profiles
quick gateway apply profiles -f schema-user-profile.gql
```

---

Then, you create the input topics for:  

- albums data
    ```shell
    quick topic create albums \ 
        --key long \
        --value schema -s profiles.Item
    ```    
- artists data
    ```shell
    quick topic create artists \ 
        --key long \
        --value schema -s profiles.Item
    ```    
- tracks data 
    ```shell
    quick topic create tracks \ 
        --key long \
        --value schema -s profiles.Item
    ```
- listening events

    ```shell
    quick topic create listeningevents \
        --key long \
        --value schema -s profiles.ListeningEvent
    ```



The command expects the topic name as well as the type or schema of key and value.
Since we have complex values, we define a global GraphQL schema and apply it to the gateway.
That way we will not need to specify a file, but use <name of the gateway>.<name of the type> from the global GraphQL schema for topic creation.
